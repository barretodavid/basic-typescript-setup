# Basic Typescript Setup

This is a basic setup for working with Typescript and Typings in a NodeJS environment as shown in the post [Setting Up a Basic Typescript Environment](http://david-barreto.com/setting-up-a-basic-typescript-environment/). 

To install the libraries and run typescript in watch mode:

```
npm install
npm run tsc:watch
```
